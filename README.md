Project Name: Custom printf Function
This is a C programming language project that implements a custom printf function similar to the standard library printf function. The project was developed by Peter Ekwere and Joy Emeh.

Files
The project consists of the following files:

test.c: This file contains the main function that calls the custom printf function and prints the output to the console.

_printf.c: This file contains the implementation of the custom printf function.

handle_format_specifier.c: This file contains helper functions that handle specific format specifiers such as %d, %s, %x, etc.

main.h: This is the header file for the project.

print_X_specifier.c: This file contains the implementation of the %X format specifier.

print_b_specifier.c: This file contains the implementation of the %b format specifier.

print_c_specifier.c: This file contains the implementation of the %c format specifier.

print_d_specifier.c: This file contains the implementation of the %d format specifier.

print_i_specifier.c: This file contains the implementation of the %i format specifier.

print_o_specifier.c: This file contains the implementation of the %o format specifier.

print_p_specifier.c: This file contains the implementation of the %p format specifier.

print_percent.c: This file contains the implementation of the %% format specifier.

print_r_specifier.c: This file contains the implementation of the %r format specifier.

print_s_specifier.c: This file contains the implementation of the %s format specifier.

print_u_specifier.c: This file contains the implementation of the %u format specifier.

print_x_specifier.c: This file contains the implementation of the %x format specifier.

Usage
To use the custom printf function in your C program, include the main.h header file and call the function using the following syntax:
